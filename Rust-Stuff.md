## Getting Started

_Resources:_

* [A Brief Version of the Rust book](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html)
* [Building a Web Server Using Networking Tools in Rust's Standard Library](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html)

## Use VsCode's [Rust-Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) Extension

* Rust analyzer has been ported to other code editors as well, not just VS code.
* It is an AMAZING VS code extension. Some of the best language support I've ever seen in VS code tbh.
* I use VS Code with rust-analyzer. I will best be able to help you with editor issues if you use this.

## Fully integrated Rust IDE: [**Rust Rover**](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/)

* Probably overkill for our project, but it might have copilot.
* This tool is new for me, but a lot of people like JetBrains IDEs.
