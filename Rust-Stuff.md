## Getting Started

_Resources:_

* [A Brief Version of the Rust book](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html)
* [Building a Web Server Using Networking Tools in Rust's Standard Library](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html)

## Use VsCode's [Rust-Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) Extension

* Rust analyzer has been ported to other code editors as well, not just VS code.
* It is an AMAZING VS code extension. Some of the best language support I've ever seen in VS code tbh.
* I use VS Code with rust-analyzer. I will best be able to help you with editor issues if you use this.

## Fully integrated Rust IDE: [**Rust Rover**](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/)

* Probably overkill for our project, but it might have copilot.
* This tool is new for me, but a lot of people like JetBrains IDEs.

## Libraries to Consider Using

* [fast and concurrent hash map](https://crates.io/crates/dashmap)
* [static variables with runtime initialization](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static)

* [serde JSON extension](https://crates.io/crates/serde_json)
* [serde XML extension](https://crates.io/crates/serde_xml)
* [serde MessagePack extension for server-headset interaction](https://lib.rs/crates/rmp-serde)
