**GitLab Work Breakdown Structure: (see the **[**wiki page for user stories**](https://gitlab.cs.unh.edu/groups/mobile-vr-lab/-/wikis/user-stories#work-breakdown-structure)**)**

- _Main Initiatives:_

  Our project is organized under two main initiatives identified in the User Stories documentâ€™s WBS table:
  1. Instructor App: This initiative focuses on developing an application that allows instructors to interact, control, and monitor the virtual reality (VR) environment effectively.
  2. Mobile VR Unity Application: Under this initiative, we aim to develop a mobile application that provides an immersive VR experience, seamlessly integrating with the Instructor App.
- _Epics Under each main initiative:_

  There are four primary Epics which act as the overarching categories for our tasks:
  1. Planning: This Epic involves tasks related to project planning and initial strategy development.
  2. Preparation: Tasks under this Epic deal with the groundwork and prerequisites necessary for the main development phase.
  3. MVP (Minimum Viable Product): This Epic encompasses tasks aimed at developing a functional prototype of the application.
  4. Documentation: All tasks related to documenting the development process, user guides, and technical manuals fall under this Epic.
- Sub-Epics and User Stories:

  Each Epic contains Sub-Epics, which correspond to specific User Stories. These User Stories are integral components of our project, each representing a functionality or feature we aim to develop. The User Stories are as follows (listed in no particular order):
   1. Hand Gesture Navigation
   2. Virtual Boundaries
   3. Real-Time Scene Viewing
   4. Script Loading
   5. Interactive Script
   6. Transparency Mode Scene
   7. Navigation Control
   8. Attention Mode
   9. Headset Connectivity Status
  10. OpenAPI Schema
- Issues Issues in GitLab:

  Issues are categorized under their respective projects and are linked to the corresponding Sub-Epic and any other elated issues. Each one represents a specific task or responsibility associated with developing the features outlined in the User Stories.
