## Getting Started

* [A much briefer version of the Rust book](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html)
* \[A description of implementing a web server using the standard library's networking tools\](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html)

---

## Use [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)

* Rust analyzer has been ported to other code editors as well, not just VS code.
* It is an AMAZING VS code extension. Some of the best language support I've ever seen in VS code tbh.
* I use VS Code with rust-analyzer. I will best be able to help you with editor issues if you use this.

## Fully integrated Rust IDE: [**Rust Rover**](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/)

* Probably overkill for our project, but it might have copilot.
* This tool is new for me, but a lot of people like JetBrains IDEs.
